            <h1 class="tiletitle fade-anim js-scroll">RPG</h1>
            <p class="tiletext fade-anim js-scroll">RPG is a full TTRPG setting and system that I have been working on. In the coming months I will be posting an early playtest version of the game. If the playtest is well recieved, I plan to set up a crowdfunding campaign so I can commission high quality artwork for the game.<br>
            The setting of RPG is a high fantasy world, Noxstellus, where magic is commonplace. Noxstellus is full of fantasy races, nations, and locations for players to explore and interact with. The core dice system of RPG is d6 success based rolls. Characters have a set of Attributes and Skills. When a situation calls for their abilities to be tested, they roll a number of d6s equal to the sum of the relevant attribute and skill, counting any 5s and 6s on the rolled dice as successes. Characters also possess magical abilities that they can call upon to enhance their rolls.

            <h1 class="tiletitle fade-anim js-scroll">RPG Character Builder</h1>
            <p class="tiletext fade-anim js-scroll">Alongside the development of RPG, I am creating a desktop application to help with character building and progression for the system. The app will let users create and view characters, track and spend experience, and eventually import characters directly to Roll20 VTT sheets. The program is written in Python, using PyQt for the GUI.</p>
